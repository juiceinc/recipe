.. module:: recipe


This page gives a good introduction in how to get started with Recipe. This
assumes you already have Recipe installed. If you do not, head over to
:ref:`Installing Recipe <install>`.

First, make sure that:

* Recipe is :ref:`installed <install>`
* Recipe is :ref:`up-to-date <updates>`

Let's gets started with some simple use cases and examples.


------------------
Creating a Shelf
------------------


A :class:`Shelf <recipe.Shelf>` is a place to store SQL fragments. In recipe
these are called :class:`Ingredients <recipe.Ingredient>`. Ingredients can
contain columns that should be part of the ``SELECT`` portion of a query,
filters that are part of the ``WHERE`` clause of a query, group_bys that
contribute to a query's ``GROUP BY`` and havings which add ``HAVING`` limits
ot a query.

It's a safe bet that you won't have to construct an Ingredient
with all these parts directly because Recipe contains convenience classes
that help you build the most common SQL fragments. The two most common
Ingredient subclasses are :class:`Dimensions <recipe.Dimension>` which supply
both a column and a grouping on that column and
:class:`Metrics <recipe.Metric>` which supply a column aggregation.

Shelf acts like a dictionary. The keys are strings and the
values are Ingredients. The keys are a shortcut name for the
ingredient. Here's an example.

::

    from recipe import *

    shelf = Shelf({
        'age': WtdAvgMetric(Census.age, Census.pop2000),
        'population': Metric(func.sum(Census.pop2000)),
        'state', Dimension(Census.state)
    })

This is a shelf with two metrics (a weighted average of age, and the sum of
population) and a dimension which lets you group on US State names.


---------------------------------
Using the Shelf to build a Recipe
---------------------------------

Now that you have the shelf, you can build a recipe

List of ingredients

Dimension
~~~~~~~~~

Dimensions are groupings that exist in your data.

.. code-block:: python

    # A simple dimension
    self.shelf['state'] = Dimension(Census.state)

Adding an id
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dimensions can support separate properties for ids and values. Consider a
table of employees with an ``employee_id`` and a ``full_name``. If you had
two employees with the same name you need to be able to distinguish between
them.

.. code-block:: python

    # Support an id and a label
    self.shelf['employee']: Dimension(Employee.full_name,
                                      id_expression=Employee.id)

The id is accessible as ``employee_id`` in each row and their full name is
available as ``employee``.

Using lookups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lookup maps values in your data to descriptive names. The ``_id``
property of your dimension contains the original value.

.. code-block:: python

    # Convert M/F into Male/Female
    self.shelf['gender']: Dimension(Census.sex, lookup={'M': 'Male',
        'F': 'Female'}, lookup_default='Unknown')

If you use the gender dimension, there will be a ``gender_id`` in each row
that will be "M" or "F" and a ``gender`` in each row that will be "Male" or
"Female".
